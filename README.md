# TODO Machine de Cheems - A Task Completion App

## Hemllo again!

This used to be my fisrt react proyect, but i did it again with new stuff specially React Router DOM 7. It was from a platzi course and I'd like to update it a little bit more in the future. However, maybe I'll add more functions or change the desing because right now it's very simple. There are some notes in the code, and they're in spanish and not well written.

You can access to the deployed proyect here (https://gyuyivb.github.io/tododecheems2.0/)
